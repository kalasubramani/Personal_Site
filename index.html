        <p class="">
          I'm Kala Subramani, an accomplished and results-driven Software
          Engineer with a decade of experience in designing, developing, and
          deploying innovative software solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in Web Development,
          including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as proficiency in Java,
          C#, .NET, SQL, Oracle products, and LINUX. These skills have allowed
          me to contribute to a diverse range of projects and successfully
          tackle complex challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise spans the entire software development lifecycle, from
          requirements analysis and system design to coding, testing, and
          deployment. I take pride in delivering high-quality, scalable, and
          maintainable code that meets both user needs and business objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a decade of successful contributions to various projects, I took
          an unplanned career break to care for a loved one. After undergoing an
          intensive training in Full Stack Development at Virginia Tech Coding
          bootcamp powered by Full Stack Academy, I am actively looking out for
          job opportunities as a Full Stack Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuous learning is a cornerstone of my professional growth.
          Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege of working on a wide
          variety of projects spanning domains such as Inventory replenishment
          for retail clients, Customer Relationship Management for banking and
          finance clients, Identity and Access Management for Enterprise
          clients, Corporate Reputation, and Governance. These experiences have
          equipped me with a deep understanding of these domains, positioning me
          as a valuable asset in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collaboration is at the heart of my work philosophy. I thrive in
          cross-functional teams and have a proven track record of effective
          communication and collaboration with stakeholders, product managers,
          and fellow developers. I am passionate about fostering a positive and
          innovative team culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a forward-thinking individual, I am always excited about exploring
          new opportunities, tackling challenging problems, and contributing to
          projects that make a meaningful impact. I am currently open to new
          opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills in Full Stack
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's connect! I am open to networking, discussing potential
          collaborations, or sharing insights within the software engineering
          community. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in connecting
          or exploring ways we can collaborate.
