                I'm Kala Subramani, an accomplished and results-driven Software
                Engineer with almost a decade of experience in designing, developing, and
                deploying innovative software solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="homecontent">
                In my previous roles, I have successfully led and collaborated within
                teams developing scalable web applications, demonstrating proficiency
                in both front-end and back-end code. Throughout my career, I have
                showcased strong problem-solving skills and acquired experience across
                all phases of the software lifecycle. I take pride in delivering
                high-quality, scalable, and maintainable code that meets both user
                needs and business objectives.

                Currently working as a .NET MAUI(Multi Platform App UI) Developer,
                specializing in developing applications for Android devices.
                To stay current with the latest technologies, I recently completed a
                certificate in Full Stack Web Development, covering React, JavaScript, Express.js,
                Node.js, PostgreSQL, REST API development, and Material UI.

                Continuous learning is a cornerstone of my professional growth. I've
                had the privilege of working on a wide variety of projects spanning
                domains such as Inventory replenishment for retail clients, Customer
                Relationship Management for banking and finance clients, Identity and
                Access Management for Enterprise clients, Corporate Reputation, and
                Governance. These experiences have equipped me with a deep
                understanding of these domains, positioning me as a valuable asset in
                the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
            </p>

                Collaboration is at the heart of my work philosophy. I thrive in
                cross-functional teams and have a proven track record of effective
                communication and collaboration with stakeholders, product managers,
                and fellow developers. I am passionate about fostering a positive and
                innovative team culture.
            </p>
            <p class="homecontent">
                I am always excited about exploring
                new opportunities, tackling challenging problems, and contributing to
                projects that make a meaningful impact. I am currently open to new
                opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills in Full Stack
                development.
            </p>
