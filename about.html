              Gardening allows you to focus on something that will give
               you a feeling of true achievement. In the garden I tend to drop 
               my thoughts here and there. The flowers are something so beautiful 
               could not be designed by human hands. There is a saying that God
                made rainy days so gardeners could get the housework done.

              Leave the road, take the trails.              
              The warm sunshine on your face, the sound of the wind rushing through 
              the trees overhead, and the soft earthy feel of the trail under your 
              boots - one would realize that<br><br>

              There’s an immense sense of achievement at reaching a summit after 
              hours of walking, and a sense of wonder as you take in the views. 
              For sure, there is no better hiking companion than a dog.

              No matter how many guidebooks you read, you can’t understand a 
              place/country like someone who has lived in it and been a part of 
              its culture. Try new things, meet new people, and look beyond 
              what is right in front of you. Those are the keys to understanding 
              this amazing world we live in ! <br><br>
              <span class="hobbySaying">Leave room for spontaneous or spur-of-the-moment experiences! </span>
              Those will be the ones you remember.
